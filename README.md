3. **Profit and ROI Calculation**: Added new columns to measure profit and ROI directly from revenues and budgets, enabling precise financial analysis.
4. **Historical Analysis**: Assessed trends across different decades to uncover changes in profitability and popularity over time.
5. **Statistical Analysis**: Grouped data by release year and genre to understand trends and performance indicators more comprehensively.
6. **Feature Engineering**: Extracted and transformed features like release month and genre to facilitate deeper analysis on audience attendance and genre popularity.
7. **Visualization**: Created comprehensive visualizations to represent trends effectively, simplifying the interpretation of complex data.

## Key Insights
1. **ROI Trends**: The 1980s had the highest ROI, marking it as a peak era for profitable film production.
